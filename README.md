## Introduction

This project is an implementation of Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to find the most probable graphs based on user input. User can specify the number of nodes, the coordination of the nodes, the source node, r, t factors and the number of iterations. The relative probability of the graphs are given by the following function:

$$ f ( \{ s_i , X_i \}, \{s_j , X_j\}) = e^{-(\theta(s_j,X_j) - \theta(s_i,X_i))/T} $$

where,

$$\theta(s_i,X_i) = r\sum_e w_e+\sum_k^M \sum_{e \in p_{s_i k}} w_e$$

In this equation, the first sum is the total weight of the graph (weight of an edge is the distance between the two nodes). The second sum is the total weight of source node to other nodes.

The proposal distribution is defined such that in case of adding an edge:

$$q(j|i) = \frac{1}{\frac{M(M-1)}{2}-E}$$

where the M is the number of nodes and the M term is the maximum number of edges. E is the number of edges in current state.

In case of deleting an edge:

$$q(j|i) = \frac{1}{E -B}$$

where B is the number of bridge. Bridge is an edge which will make the graph disconnected if being deleted.

The acceptance rate is defined as following:

$$A = min\{ 1, \frac{\pi (x_j) q(x_i|x_j)}{\pi (x_i)q(x_j|x_i)} \}$$
